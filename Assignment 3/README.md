# Assignment 3
This assignment focuses on getting us know more about **CSS**. It has two parts. The first one just contains a simple HTML and CSS file. The second one is for the Vecta Corp website that we have been building previously. It contains an **index.html** file for the home page of Vecta Corporation, **aboutus.html** for the company overview, **pricing.html** for the pricing information, **solutions.html** for the product information and **contactus.html** for the contact information.
